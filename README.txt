Methods used:- Word2Vec, TFIDF and BERT Embeddings

All the three methods have been placed inside their respective folders. The folders contain the respective ipynb notebooks.
Please run the respective notebooks using jupytr (Anaconda). You may need to install some of the dependencies 
which are specified in the code.

For running the BERT ipynb on google colab, you need to extract and upload the folder with the name NLP in your 'content/MyDrive'
directory. The notebook can be placed probably anywhere in the drive, since the paths are absolutes and it wouldn't matter where the data is. 
You may also upload data as per your choice of directory and then change the paths accordingly in the code.

For the other 2 methods, if you change the location/name of the train and test set, please change it in the relative 
paths provided in the notebooks

The final CSV with predictions is available in the respective folders of the methods and the proposed one is available in the root folder

Note: BERT has been coded in Google colab and it is highly recommended to run it in the same environment.
